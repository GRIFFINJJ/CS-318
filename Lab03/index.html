            <h1>Several-hundred Million Year Dynasty Earth Dominating Super-Lizards</h1>
            <P>Dinosaurs walked the earth for hundreds of millions of years, the broader classification of thousands of species evolving from common ancestors that emerged from Earth's ancient oceans. The anatomy of these creatures continue to surprise scientists as more is discovered about these creatures. Dinosaurs sometimes appear to have some very unique methods of getting around and surviving, some creatures evolving unique tools to continue their lineages through natural selection. Whether it was the long tails used for balance by the sauropods, or the hollow bones of the pterosaurs, we see continuations of these evolutionary traits in certain species of bird and lizards to this day.</P>
            <P>Theropods and other families of carnivorous dinosaurs evolved to become the apex predators of their environments, creating creatures that were very much masters of hunting and surviving within their environments. Other creatures evolved capabilities of defending themselves from carnivourous dinosaurs, such as a stegosaurs's spiked tail, or a triceratops's head spikes. Either way, these creatures were formidible in their evasion, natural evolved weapon like appendages, and survival. Several modern creatures haven't lived for nearly as long as many dinosaur species persisted across the Mesozoic Era. </P>
            <h2>Reasons Why I like Dinosaurs</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The scale of the creatures and their physical forms remind me of monsters of myth and legend, but they were very much real.</li>
                <li>There are so many different kinds of dinosaur, each with their own unique stories as to how they survived. </li>
                <li>They show how life has shifted and changed and create an interesting narrative to how earth has changed over millions of years.</li>
                <li>There is a lot of mystery surrounding the ancient creatures that folks are still figuring out.</li>
                <li>We gave them some really interesting names. The latin names that tend to be given by most scientists are usually accurate to the creature's appearance and are often phoneticaly satisfying. I think it's great that nations outside of Europe and America can use their own naming conventions and bring some variety to an already super cool system of naming.</li>
            </ol>
